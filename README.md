 To work with this repository you need:
    <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clone this repository to your computer using the command:
        <br><code
          >git clone git@github.com:godlikeAlex/surron-ecommerce.git</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to the project folder:
        <br><code>cd surron-ecommerce</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to the branch of the project you are interested in, for example,
        develop:
        <br><code>git checkout develop</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Install all necessary dependencies:
        <br><code>npm i</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a folder with settings for husky to correctly check possible future
        commits:
        <br><code>npm run prepare</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Find a file in the project called <code>.env.example</code>, copy it,
        rename the created copy to <code>.env</code> and fill in the values of
        the corresponding variables in the file with the data obtained in
        CommerceTools.
      </li>
	  <li>
        In order for Stylelint to work, the corresponding plugin must be installed in VS Code. Also add the following to your settings.json (if you haven't done this already): "stylelint.validate":
		<br><code>["css", "scss", "sass", "less"]</code>
      </li>
	  <li>
	  In order for SCSS modules to work properly you need to add corresponding settings in VS Code. The easiest way to do this is to just add the the following to your settings.json (read more  <a href="https://github.com/mrmckeb/typescript-plugin-css-modules?tab=readme-ov-file#visual-studio-code">here</a>):
	  <br><code>{
  	  "typescript.tsserver.pluginPaths": ["typescript-plugin-css-modules"]
	  }</code>
	  </li>
      <li>
        Launch the project (the developer mode launch option is specified, other
        launch options can be found in the <a href="#scripts-section">scripts section</a>:
